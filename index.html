    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <p>To help answer these questions, we analyzed household-level data to understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i class="fa fa-line-chart fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i>What are the trends in these variables?</li>
      <li><i class="fa fa-globe fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i>Where within the country is the greatest need?</li>

        <li>Though Rwanda has had dramatic economic growth in the past 25 years,
        chronic child malnutrition remains high across the country,

        <li>Chronic malnutrition, indicated by children whose height is stunted for their age, is associated with long-term problems.</li>
