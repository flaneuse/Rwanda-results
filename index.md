# Headline which summarizes everything.

## High level findings
1. Geography matters.
  * Patterns in malnutrition and fertility cross across administrative borders and livelihood zones.
  * Improvements in malnutrition between 2010 and 2014/2015 are not equal across the country.
  * The northwest corner of Rwanda has significantly higher malnutrition, [lower contraception use].

2. Basic needs to prevent stunting are being met, but more work is needed.
  * Improved sanitation and water access increased markedly in the past five years.
3. Fertility and Modern Contraceptive Use are virtually unaffected by wealth.


## Motivation
> # Why is stunting so high?
Though Rwanda has had dramatic economic growth in the past 25 years
![Rwanda GDP over time]({{site.baseurl}}/img/gdp.png), chronic child malnutrition remains high across the country, affecting <mark>nearly 40% of children under 5</mark>. Why aren't economic improvements being translated as quickly to improvements in stunting?

> # Why does fertility remain high?
The total fertility rate &mdash; how many children a woman will have in her lifetime &mdash; has decreased from a peak of XX to <mark>4.2 children/woman</mark> on average. However, the fertility rate is leveling off rather than continuing to decrease, which will introduce strain on systems, especially since Rwanda is already the densest nation in Africa. What's responsible for the slow down?

### What did we do?
To help answer these questions, we analyzed household-level data to understand:

* What are the trends in these variables?
* Where within the country is the greatest need?
* Who is most affected by malnutrition and high fertility?
* Why are certain households affected and others aren't?
* How does this information relate to USAID Rwanda's investments?
