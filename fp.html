          <div class="paragraph">Rwanda has experienced signficant declines in total fertility rate (TFR) &ndash; an estimate of the total number of children a woman will have in her lifetime.</div>
          <div class="paragraph">Compared to its neighbor Uganda, TFR is at a much lower level in 2014/2015: <mark>4.2 children/woman</mark>, similar to Kenya.</div>
          <div class="paragraph">However, despite progress in reducing population growth, the estimated fertility rate has changed little since the last survey in 2010.
            What are the trends and contributing factors in family planning?</div>

          <div class="paragraph">Since high fertility rates could be explained by either access to contraception to limit
            or space pregnancies, by social desires for more children, or both,
            we analyzed the 2010 and the 2014/2015 Demographic and Health Surveys to tease apart the patterns
            that contribute to steady TFR rates.</div>

            were more likely to use modern contraception, while women in the Lake Kivu Coffee region were less likely.</li>

          <div class="paragraph">When exploring the distribution of modern contraception use in married women, one trend sticks out:
Protestant married women report much lower use.</div>
<div class="paragraph">We ran regressions to account for other demographic and geographc factors which may explain this trend.</div>
<div class="paragraph">After taking into account factors like age, education, and wealth, we found:</div>

  <li>Protestant married women are less likely than Catholic women to use modern contraception, in both 2010 and 2014/2015.</li>
